> **Tip:** You can generate a secure key using the following command:
> `openssl rand -base64 32`

### 4. Database Setup

This project uses Drizzle ORM for database migrations. To ensure isolation between development and production environments, the project is configured with two separate database configuration files:

- `database/config.ts` - Development environment configuration, migration files output to `database/migrations/development/`
- `database/config.prod.ts` - Production environment configuration, migration files output to `database/migrations/production/`

#### Development Environment

For local development, we recommend using the `push` command to directly sync `schema.ts` changes to the database:

```bash
# Ensure local PostgreSQL database is running
pnpm db:push
```

Alternatively, you can use the traditional migration file approach:

```bash
pnpm db:generate  # Generate migration files based on schema changes
pnpm db:migrate:dev # Apply migration files to development database
```

#### Production Environment

**Important:** Production environments **must** use SQL migration file-based approach to ensure traceability and security of database changes.

```bash
# 1. In development environment, generate migration files based on schema changes
pnpm db:generate

# 2. Generate migration files for production environment (using separate production config)
pnpm db:generate:prod

# 3. Deploy code (including newly generated migration files) to production environment

# 4. In production environment (usually through CI/CD pipeline), apply migrations
pnpm db:migrate:prod
```

> **Security Tips:**
>
> - **Never** use `pnpm db:push` in production environment.
> - Production environment migrations should be automated through CI/CD pipelines.
> - Always backup production database before applying migrations.

### 5. Content Management (Keystatic)

The project uses Keystatic as a Content Management System (CMS) for managing blog posts and other content.

- **Access Method:** In development environment, you can access Keystatic's management interface by visiting the `/keystatic` path.
- **Production Environment Limitation:** For security reasons, Keystatic's management interface and related APIs are disabled by default in production environment. This means you cannot access the management backend through the `/keystatic` path after deployment to production servers.

### 6. Start Development Server

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Now your application should be running at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)!

### 7. Admin Account Setup

For security reasons, the system no longer automatically sets the first registered user as super admin. You need to manually specify the super admin through a secure script.

**Setup Process:**

1. First, ensure the user you want to promote to admin has already registered an account in the system through normal registration.
2. In your server (using environment variables) or local development environment (using .env file as environment variables), run the following command.
   Available in server environment:

   ```bash
   pnpm set:admin:prod --email=your-email@example.com
   ```

   Available in local development environment:

   ```bash
   pnpm set:admin --email=your-email@example.com
   ```

   Replace `your-email@example.com` with the registered email of the user you want to promote.

3. After successful script execution, the user will have super admin (`super_admin`) privileges and can access all management functions under the `/dashboard/admin` path.

**Security Tips:**

- Please ensure this privilege is only granted to trusted users.
- This command should be executed in a secure environment to avoid exposing sensitive information.

## üìÅ File Upload Feature

This project integrates a secure file upload system based on Cloudflare R2.

### 1. Cloudflare R2 Configuration

1. **Create R2 Bucket**: Log into Cloudflare Dashboard, navigate to R2 and create a new bucket.
2. **Get API Token**: In the R2 overview page, click "Manage R2 API Tokens", create a token with "Object Read & Write" permissions. Note down the `Access Key ID` and `Secret Access Key`.
3. **Set Environment Variables**: Fill your R2 credentials and information into the `.env` file.
4. **Configure CORS Policy**: To allow browsers to upload files directly, you need to configure CORS policy in your R2 bucket's "Settings". Add the following configuration, replacing the URLs in `AllowedOrigins` with your own:

```json
[
  {
    "AllowedOrigins": ["http://localhost:3000", "https://yourdomain.com"],
    "AllowedMethods": ["PUT", "GET"],
    "AllowedHeaders": ["*"],
    "ExposeHeaders": ["ETag"],
    "MaxAgeSeconds": 3000
  }
]
```

### 2. Using the `FileUploader` Component

We provide a powerful `FileUploader` component that supports drag-and-drop, progress display, image compression, and error handling.

#### Basic Usage

```tsx
import { FileUploader } from "@/components/ui/file-uploader";

function MyComponent() {
  const handleUploadComplete = (files) => {
    console.log("Upload complete:", files);
    // Handle uploaded file information here
  };

  return (
    <FileUploader
      acceptedFileTypes={["image/png", "image/jpeg", "application/pdf"]}
      maxFileSize={5 * 1024 * 1024} // 5MB
      maxFiles={3}
      onUploadComplete={handleUploadComplete}
    />
  );
}
```

#### Image Compression

The component includes built-in client-side image compression functionality that can reduce image file size before upload, saving bandwidth and storage space.

```tsx
<FileUploader
  acceptedFileTypes={["image/png", "image/jpeg", "image/webp"]}
  enableImageCompression={true}
  imageCompressionQuality={0.7} // Compression quality (0.1-1.0)
  imageCompressionMaxWidth={1200} // Maximum width after compression
/>
```

## üìä Bundle Size Monitoring & Optimization

This project integrates `@next/bundle-analyzer` to help you analyze and optimize your application's bundle size.

### How to Run Analysis

```bash
# Analyze production build
pnpm analyze

# Analyze in development mode
pnpm analyze:dev
```

After execution, bundle size analysis reports for both client and server will automatically open in your browser.

### Optimization Strategies

- **Dynamic Imports**: Use `next/dynamic` for code splitting of large components or libraries that aren't needed on first screen.
- **Dependency Optimization**:
  - **Tree Shaking**: Ensure you only import what you need from libraries, e.g., `import { debounce } from 'lodash-es';` instead of `import _ from 'lodash';`.
  - **Lightweight Alternatives**: Consider using lighter libraries, e.g., replace `moment.js` with `date-fns`.
- **Image Optimization**: Prioritize using Next.js `<Image>` component and enable WebP format.

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Deployment

We recommend using [Vercel](https://vercel.com) for deployment as it seamlessly integrates with Next.js.

1. **Push to Git Repository:**
   Push your code to a GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket repository.

2. **Import Project in Vercel:**

   - Log into your Vercel account, click "Add New... > Project", then select your Git repository.
   - Vercel will automatically detect this is a Next.js project and configure the build settings.

3. **Configure Environment Variables:**

   - In your Vercel project's "Settings" -> "Environment Variables", add all the environment variables you defined in your `.env` file. **Do not commit the `.env` file to your Git repository**.

4. **Configure Production Database Migration:**
   After successful deployment, execute database migration separately: `pnpm db:migrate:prod`

5. **Deploy!**
   After completing the above steps, Vercel will automatically build and deploy your application every time you push to the main branch.
